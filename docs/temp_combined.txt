# Introduction

Welcome to the Overseerr Documentation.

## Features

- **Full Plex integration**. Login and manage user access with Plex.
- **Syncs to your Plex library** to show what titles you already have.
- **Integrates with Sonarr and Radarr**. With more services to come in the future.
- **Easy to use request system** allowing users to request individual seasons or movies in a friendly, clean UI.
- **Simple request management UI**. Don't dig through the app to approve recent requests.
- **Mobile-friendly design**, for when you need to approve requests on the go.
- Granular permission system.
- Localization into other languages.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for starting this project was to have an incredibly performant and easy to use application. There is a heavy focus on the user experience for both the server owner and the users. We feel requesting should be **effortless for the user**. Find the media you want, click request, and branch off efficiently into other titles that interest you, all in one seamless flow. For the server owner, Overseerr takes all the hassle out of approving your users' requests.

## We need your help!

Overseerr is an ambitious project. We have already poured a lot of work into this, and have a lot more to do. We need your valuable feedback and help to find and fix bugs. Also, with Overseerr being an open-source project, anyone is welcome to contribute. Contribution includes building new features, patching bugs, translating the application, or even just writing documentation.

If you would like to contribute, please be sure to review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General

### How do I keep Overseerr up-to-date?

Use a third-party update mechanism (such as [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower), [Ouroboros](https://github.com/pyouroboros/ouroboros), or [Pullio](https://hotio.dev/pullio)) to keep Overseerr up-to-date automatically.

### How can I access Overseerr outside of my home network?

The easiest but least secure method is to simply forward an external port (e.g., `5055`) on your router to the internal port used by Overseerr (default is TCP `5055`). Visit [Port Forward](http://portforward.com/) for instructions for your particular router. You would then be able to access Overseerr via `http://EXTERNAL-IP-ADDRESS:5055`.

A more advanced, user-friendly, and secure (if using SSL) method is to set up a web server and use a reverse proxy to access Overseerr. Please refer to our [reverse proxy examples](../extending-overseerr/reverse-proxy.md) for more information.

The most secure method (but also the most inconvenient method) is to set up a VPN tunnel to your home server. You would then be able to access Overseerr as if you were on your local network, via `http://LOCAL-IP-ADDRESS:5055`.

### Are there mobile apps for Overseerr?

Since Overseerr has an almost native app experience when installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), there are no plans to develop mobile apps for Overseerr.

Out of the box, Overseerr already fulfills most of the [PWA install criteria](https://web.dev/install-criteria/). You simply need to make sure that your Overseerr instance is being served over HTTPS (e.g., via a [reverse proxy](../extending-overseerr/reverse-proxy.md)).

### Overseerr is amazing! But it is not translated in my language yet! Can I help with translations?

You sure can! We are using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/overseerr/) for translations. If your language is not listed, please [open a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/issues/new/choose).

### Where can I find the changelog?

You can find the changelog for your version (stable/`latest`,s or `develop`) in the **Settings &rarr; About** page in your Overseerr instance.

You can alternatively review the [stable release history](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/releases) and [`develop` branch commit history](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/commits/develop) on GitHub.

### Some media is missing from Overseerr that I know is in Plex!

Overseerr currently supports the following agents:

- New Plex Movie
- Legacy Plex Movie
- New Plex TV
- Legacy Plex TV
- TheTVDB
- TMDB
- [HAMA](https://github.com/ZeroQI/Hama.bundle)

Please verify that your library is using one of the agents previously listed.

When changing agents, a full metadata refresh of your Plex library is required. (Caution: This can take a long time depending on the size of your library.)

#### Troubleshooting Steps

First, check the Overseerr logs for media items that are missing. The logs will contain an error as to why that item could not be matched.

1. Verify that you are using one of the agents mentioned above.
2. Refresh the metadata for just that item.
3. Run a full scan in Overseerr to see if that item is now matched properly.
4. If the item is now seen by Overseerr then repeat step 2 for each missing item. If you have a large amount of items missing then a full metadata refresh is recommended for that library.
5. Run a full scan on Overseerr after refreshing all unmatched items.

You can also perform the following to verify the media item has a GUID Overseerr can match:

1. Go to the media item in Plex and **"Get info"** and click on **"View XML"**.
2. Verify that the media item's GUID follows one of the below formats:

   1. TMDB agent `guid="com.plexapp.agents.themoviedb://1705"`
   2. New Plex Movie agent `<Guid id="tmdb://464052"/>`
   3. TheTVDB agent `guid="com.plexapp.agents.thetvdb://78874/1/1"`
   4. Legacy Plex Movie agent `guid="com.plexapp.agents.imdb://tt0765446"`

### Where can I find the log files?

Please see [these instructions on how to locate and share your logs](./need-help.md#how-can-i-share-my-logs).

## Users

### Why can't I see all of my Plex users?

Please see the [documentation for importing users from Plex](../using-overseerr/users/README.md#importing-users-from-plex).

### Can I create local users in Overseerr?

Yes! Please see the [documentation for creating local users](../using-overseerr/users/README.md#creating-local-users).

### Is is possible to set user roles in Overseerr?

Permissions can be configured for each user via the **User List** or their **User Settings** page. The list of assignable permissions is still growing, so if you have any suggestions, [submit a feature request](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/issues/new/choose)!

## Requests

### I receive 409 or 400 errors when requesting a movie or TV series!

Verify you are running v3 of both Radarr and Sonarr. Overseerr is not backwards-compatible with previous versions.

### Can I allow users to submit 4K requests?

Yes! If you keep both non-4K and 4K content in your media libraries, you can link separate 4K Radarr/Sonarr servers to allow users to submit 4K requests. (You must configure default non-4K **and** default 4K Radarr/Sonarr servers.)

Please see the [Services documentation](../using-overseerr/settings/README.md#services) for details on how to configure your Radarr and/or Sonarr servers.

Note that users must also have the **Request 4K**, **Request 4K Movies**, and/or **Request 4K Series** permissions in order to submit requests for 4K content.

### I approved a requested movie and Radarr didn't search for it!

Check the minimum availability setting in your Radarr server. If a movie does not meet the minimum availability requirement, no search will be performed. Also verify that Radarr did not perform a search, by checking the Radarr logs. Lastly, verify that the item was not already being monitored by Radarr prior to approving the request.

### Help! My request still shows "requested" even though it is in Plex!

See "[Some media is missing from Overseerr that I know is in Plex!](#some-media-is-missing-from-overseerr-that-i-know-is-in-plex)" for troubleshooting steps.

### Series requests keep failing!

If you configured a URL base in Sonarr, make sure you have also configured the [URL Base](../using-overseerr/settings/README.md#url-base) setting for your Sonarr server in Overseerr.

Also, check that you are using Sonarr v3 and that you have configured a default language profile in Overseerr.

Language profile support for Sonarr was added in [v1.20.0](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/releases/tag/v1.20.0) along with a new, _required_ **Language Profile** setting. If series requests are failing, make sure that you have a default language profile configured for each of your Sonarr servers in **Settings &rarr; Services**.

## Notifications

### I am getting "Username and Password not accepted" when attempting to send email notifications via Gmail!

If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your account, you will need to create an [app password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833).

### The logo image in email notifications is broken!

This may be an issue with how you are proxying your Overseerr instance. A good first troubleshooting step is to verify that the [`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) being set by your proxy (if any) is configured appropriately to allow external embedding of the image.

For Gmail users, another possible issue is that Google's image URL proxy is being blocked from fetching the image. If using Cloudflare, overzealous firewall rules could be the culprit.

If you still have questions after troubleshooting on your own, feel free to ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/overseerr)! (Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cyb3rgh05t/streamnetvod/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting.)

Be sure to also include a link to your logs. (Please see [How can I share my logs?](#how-can-i-share-my-logs) below.)

## What should I include when requesting support?

Please try to include as much information as possible. A vague statement like "it doesn't work" provides very little to go on, and makes it difficult for us to help you.

Try to answer the following questions:

- What version of Overseerr are you running? (You can find this in Settings → About → Version.)
- How did you install Overseerr? Are you using the official Docker or snap images, or images published by a third-party?
- How are you accessing Overseerr?
  - Are you accessing Overseerr through your reverse proxy or via a local IP address?
  - What browser are you using? What browser extensions are enabled?
- What were you trying to do, and how did you attempt it?
  - What command did you enter?
  - What did you click on?
  - What settings did you change?
  - Did you follow official instructions, or a third-party guide?
  - Provide a step-by-step list of what you tried.
  - Provide a brief description of your setup.
- What exactly do you see?
  - Did something happen?
  - Did something not happen?
  - Are there any error messages showing?
  - Provide screenshots to help us see what you are seeing.
  - Share your Overseerr logs, which show exactly what happened and are often critical for identifying issues (see [How can I share my logs?](#how-can-i-share-my-logs) below).

## How can I share my logs?

1. Locate the current log file at `<your Overseerr config directory>/logs/overseerr.log`.
2. Open the log file and **copy its contents** into a [**secret gist** on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/). If you upload your logs elsewhere, we may ask you to share them again via GitHub Gist.
3. **Share the link/URL to your secret gist** in the [`#support` channel in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/overseerr).
